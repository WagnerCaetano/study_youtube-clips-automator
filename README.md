# MARCELO: an AI bot to automate the editing and thumbnail creation for your Youtube clips channel

This project uses machine learning (AI) to automate the management of your Youtube clips channel by clipping, editing, creating of thumbnails and uploading to your YT channel

## Requirements

- Python 3
- [Youtube uploader](https://github.com/porjo/youtubeuploader/releases)
- OpenCV
- ffmpeg

## Setup

1. Download the latest version of [youtubeuploader](https://github.com/porjo/youtubeuploader/releases) and extract the executable go file in the project's `./` folder
2. Configure Youtube API v3 accordingly [Youtube Uploader instructions](https://github.com/porjo/youtubeuploader/blob/master/README.md)
3. Install python requirements
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Populate the folder `./backgrounds` with images `.png` to be randomly selected to your thumbnail
5. Leave a `default_face.png` on `./assets` folder just in case the bot is not able to find a smiling face on your video
6. \[Optional] Leave a `opening.mp4` and `ending.mp4` videos (MP4 encoded, 1920x1080) on `assets/` dir to automatically insert an intro and ending sessions on your edited video

## Usage

1. Prepare a spreadsheet with the following fields (example ./list-sample.csv):
   
| url | time_from | time_to | podcast | title | description | tags | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=[VIDEO_ID] | 00:00:14 | 00:01:46 | 0 | TITLE | DESCRIPTION | tag1 tag2 tag3 tag4 | 
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=[VIDEO_ID2] |  |  | 0 | TITLE | DESCRIPTION | tag1 tag2 tag3 tag4 |

- **URL**: Youtube url
- **time_from**: Clip start time (leave it blank for the entire video)
- **time_to**: Clip end time (leave it blank for the entire video)
- **podcast**: it will extract the edited audio for a podcast (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET - leave it 0)
- **title**: Video clip title (don't use comma)
- **description**: Video clip description (don't use comma)
- **tags**: Video tags splitted by spaces (don't use comma)

1. Save the spreadsheet as a `csv` and place the `list.csv` file in the project folder

2. Run `marcelo.py`
```
$ python marcelo.py
```

## How it works

This project execute is executed in 4 phases:

1. **Download and cut**: Download and cut the video if needed
2. **Editing**: A bot will scan the entire video to find audio silences, to cut and edit the video automatically
3. **Thumbnail**: A bot will use machine learning through Computer Vision to find smiling faces in the video, to extract samples and build an unique thumbnail for your channel
4. **Upload**: Prepare the metadata and Upload the video to your Youtube channel
5. **Marcelo**: is a tribute to [Marcelo Rezende](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcelo_Rezende), a Brazilian journalist and television presenter who used to say 'Corta pra mim'
